# speaker
It's a program that talks with Spanish or English accent. Its a little stupid project :) . to have fun

# Requirements:
- Linux o Unix-like system as OS
- QT 5 library C++ (Qt Creator)
- festival 
~~~
sudo apt get install festival
~~~

# How it works.
It creates a temporary file in /tmp from which "festival" will read and consequently speak

If you want to compile on your own, I recommend that you run the Qt creator and the destination executable file positions it in the build folder.

And now look at code, compile if you need and fun!.
